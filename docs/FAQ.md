## How do I update my Apollo Universal Starter Kit project without forking the repository?

Follow the steps below to create an Apollo Starter Kit project and updating the fork:

1. Initialize a new Git repository
2. Add the starter kit as a remote upstream repository:
3. Run the following command:

```bash
git merge upstream/stable
```

4. When you are in `master` branch of your project:

https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/

Whenever you want to receive updates, first run:

```bash
git fetch upstream
```

Then run when you are in the master branch of your project:
```bash
git merge upstream/stable
```

## How do I use a custom GraphQL back end?

To set your custom GraphQL back end endpoint, set `BACKEND_API_URL` environment variable or change URL in `packages/server/build.config.js` for the `__API_URL__` property:

```javascript
__API_URL__: process.env.BACKEND_API_URL || 'https://my-custom-domain/graphql', // set the full URL to the external GraphQL API e.g. https://
```

We recommend that you still run the back-end code provided by the starter kit to use the server-side rendering (SSR).
You can also turn off SSR if you don't use the starter kit back end. Set the environmet variable `SSR` to `false` or edit root `build.config.js`:

## How do I disable Server Side Rendering?

To disable Server Side Rendering (SSR), change set environment variable `SSR` to `false` or edit root `build.config.js`

More information: [Server Side Rendering with Apollo Universal Starter Kit].

## How do I use a different database instead of SQLite?

You can almost all relational database management systems that use SQL and are supported by [Knex] such as PostgreSQL,
MySQL, MSSQL, MariaDB, SQLite3, and Oracle.

Apollo Universal Starter Kit is database-agnostic. You can any other databases if they support a JavaScript client
provided by Knex. This way you can create a simple connector and export it normally in place of the Knex connector.

## How do I enable Facebook and Google OAuth?

You can enable the social login functionality in the `config/auth.js` file:

```javascript
export default {
  // other configurations are omitted
  auth: {
    facebook: {
          enabled: false, // set to true to enable login with Facebook
          clientID: process.env.FACEBOOK_CLIENTID,
          clientSecret: process.env.FACEBOOK_CLIENTSECRET,
          scope: ['email'],
          profileFields: ['id', 'emails', 'displayName']
    },
    github: {
      enabled: false, // set to true to enable login with GitHub
      clientID: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENTID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GITHUB_CLIENTSECRET,
      scope: ['user:email']
    },
    linkedin: {
      enabled: false, // set to true to enable login with LinkedIn
      clientID: process.env.LINKEDIN_CLIENTID,
      clientSecret: process.env.LINKEDIN_CLIENTSECRET,
      scope: ['r_emailaddress', 'r_basicprofile']
    },
    google: {
      enabled: false, // set to true to enable login with Google
      clientID: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENTID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENTSECRET,
      scope: ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email', 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile']
    }
  }
};
```

## How do I add support for a custom domain name in the local development environment?

First, modify the host file in the following way:

`127.0.0.1 localhost.host`

Then, add this setting into `/packages/client/.sprinjs` file under `options` section

```
webpackConfig: {
  devServer: {
    public: 'localhost.host'
  }
}
```

## What extensions can I use when creating files in my project?

Apollo Universal Starter Kit suggests that you use the following extensions when creating your modules:

| Platform | Directory        | Possible extensions for application files |
| -------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| server   | packages/server/ | `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.js`, `.json`     |
| web      | packages/client/ | `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.js`, `.json`     |

When you develop a native mobile app, we also recommend that you follow the naming convention below:

| Platform | Directory        | Possible extensions for application files                             |
| -------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| native   | packages/mobile/ | `.native.tsx`, `.native.jsx`, `.native.ts`, `.native.js`, `.json`     |
| android  | packages/mobile/ | `.android.tsx`, `.android.jsx`, `.android.ts`, `.android.js`, `.json` |
| ios      | packages/mobile/ | `.ios.tsx`, `.ios.jsx`, `.ios.ts`, `.ios.js`, `.json`                 |

Notice that you should use the `.native.tsx` and similar extensions for files with the same logic for both Android and
iOS platforms. If the logic for these two platforms is different, use `.android.tsx` (and similar extensions) for
Android, and `.ios.tsx` for iOS.

For example, here's how the files may be called for the Storage module:

* `storage.tsx` for the web and server platforms
* `storage.native.tsx` for the mobile app for files with the same logic
* `storage.android.tsx` for the custom logic for the Android platform
* `storage.ios.tsx` for the custom logic for the iOS platform

Apollo Universal Starter Kit uses Webpack to build the code for all the platforms &ndash; server, web, Android, and iOS.
The starter kit uses the [`resolve.extensions`] Webpack property to understand which files should be used for generating
a specific platform bundle when there are several files with the same name but different extensions.

## How do I always keep my Apollo Starter Kit project up-to-date?

The best way for keeping your Apollo Universal Starter Kit project always up-to-date is to configure a remote repository
that points to the upstream of the original repository.

You can consult [Configuring a Remote for a Fork] documentation on GitHub. Using this feature, you can easily pull in
the latest changes made to this kit. For that, consult the [Syncing a Fork].

If you intend to make significant changes to existing modules, we suggest you copy and rename the modules, to limit the
amount of merge conflicts to a minimum.
